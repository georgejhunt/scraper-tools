                     <p>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive disorder,&#160;caused
                        by the&#160;deficiency of one of the enzymes required for the synthesis of cortisol
                        in the adrenal glands. 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of
                        congenital adrenal hyperplasia (more than 90% of the cases). Glucocorticoid and
                        mineralocorticoid replacement are the mainstays of treatment.<a href="#ref_30393437"
                           id="link_30393437">[1]</a><a href="#ref_30371037" id="link_30371037">[2]</a><a

                     <p>Prenatal diagnosis and&#160;treatment of affected females are very important, to
                        minimize genital virilization. Because 21-hydroxylase deficiency is often
                        undiagnosed in affected males until they have
                        severe&#160;adrenal&#160;insufficiency, all US states and many other countries have
                        instituted newborn screening programs that measure 17-hydroxyprogesterone
                        concentration). Newborn screening&#160;can detect almost all infants with classic
                        CAH and some infants with nonclassic CAH. Although false-negative results are
                        uncommon, false-positive results are usually seen in premature infants; therefore,
                        serial measurements of 17-hydroxyprogesterone are advised for premature infants. A
                        positive newborn screening test for CAH must be confirmed by a second plasma sample
                        (17-hydroxyprogesterone), and serum electrolytes should be measured<strong>.

                     <p>CAH is an autosomal recessive disorder. The activity of 21-hydroxylase is mediated
                        by cytochrome p450c21, found in the endoplasmic reticulum.<a href="#ref_30272171"
                           id="link_30272171">[4]</a><a href="#ref_30214458" id="link_30214458">[5]</a><a

                     <p>The 21-hydroxylase genes (<em>CYP21</em>) lie within the class III region of the
                        human major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 6. The <em>CYP21 </em>gene
                        structure contains both <em>CYP21</em> and a pseudogene (<em>CYP21P</em>). <em>CYP21
                        </em>is the active gene. More than 90% of mutations causing 21-hydroxylase
                        deficiency are recombination between <em>CYP21</em> and <em>CYP21P</em>.</p>
                     <p>Multiple gene defects have been found. Several mutations entirely prevent the
                        synthesis of a functional protein; whereas, others are missense mutations that yield
                        enzymes with 1% to 50% of normal activity. Disease severity correlates well with the
                        mutations carried by an affected individual; for example, patients with
                        a&#160;salt-wasting disease usually carry mutations on both alleles that destroy
                        enzymatic activity.</p>
                     <p>Patients are frequently compound heterozygotes for different types of&#160;mutations
                        (i.e., one allele is less-severely affected than the other), in which case the
                        severity of disease expression is largely determined by the activity of the
                        less-severely affected of the 2 alleles.</p>
                     <p>Molecular genetic testing of the <em>CYP21</em> gene is available and can detect
                        common mutations and deletions in the various forms in up to 95% of affected
                        individuals.</p>

                        classical 21-hydroxylase-deficient CAH is 1 in 15,000 to 20,000 births.
                        Approximately 70% of the affected infants have the salt-wasting form, and 30% have

                     <p>Steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21, P450c21) is a cytochrome e P-450 enzyme
                        located&#160;in the endoplasmic reticulum. It hydroxylates 17-hydroxyprogesterone to
                        11-deoxycortisol, a precursor of cortisol and also hydroxylates progesterone to
                        deoxycorticosterone, a precursor of aldosterone. Both hormones (cortisol and
                        aldosterone) are deficient in the most-severe, &rsquo;salt-wasting&rsquo; form of
                        the disease.<a href="#ref_29429350" id="link_29429350">[9]</a></p>
                     <p>Due to the loss of this enzyme function, patients with a 21-hydroxylase deficiency
                        cannot synthesize cortisol efficiently, and as a result, the ACTH levels are high,
                        leading to hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and overproduction of cortisol
                        precursors. Some of these precursors are used for the synthesis of sex steroids,
                        which may cause signs of androgen excess, including ambiguous genitalia in newborn
                        girls and rapid postnatal growth in both sexes. Aldosterone deficiency may lead to
                        salt wasting with consequent failure to thrive, hypovolemia, and shock.</p>

                     <p><em><strong>Classic 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency</strong></em></p>
                     <p><em>Salt-wasting&#160;(severe form, with a defect in cortisol and aldosterone
                           biosynthesis)</em></p>
                     <p>Approximately 75% of patients with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency have the
                        salt-wasting type. It is the most severe form of the disease, and it is most often
                        associated with large gene deletions or intron mutations that result in no enzyme
                        activity.</p>
                     <p>The biochemical and clinical abnormalities of the classic form manifest both
                        prenatally and postnatally. Physicians recognize the condition in infant females in
                        the neonatal period because of ambiguous genitalia compared with that of infant
                        males. Males have normal genitalia and, in the case of the salt-wasting form, they
                        can present with nonspecific symptoms&#160;like vomiting, dehydration, and poor
                        feeding at ages 1 to 3 weeks. Hence, the diagnosis in boys can be delayed or missed.
                     </p>
                     <p>Since aldosterone regulates sodium homeostasis, untreated patients will have
                        excessive renal sodium excretion resulting in hypovolemia and hyperreninemia. These
                        patients cannot excrete potassium efficiently and are prone to hyperkalemia,
                        especially in infancy. In addition, accumulated steroid precursors may directly
                        antagonize the mineralocorticoid receptor and exacerbate mineralocorticoid
                        deficiency, particularly in untreated patients. Progesterone is well known to have
                        anti-mineralocorticoid effects.</p>
                     <p>Cortisol deficiency contributes to poor cardiac function, poor vascular response to
                        catecholamine, a decreased glomerular filtration rate, and increased secretion of
                        antidiuretic hormone. Cortisol and aldosterone deficiency together cause
                        hyponatremic dehydration and shock in inadequately treated patients.</p>
                     <p>Since high levels of glucocorticoids are needed for normal development of the
                        adrenal medulla, as well as, for expression of the enzymes required to synthesize
                        catecholamines, patients with salt-wasting type may also have catecholamine
                        deficiency, further increasing the shock.</p>
                     <p>Females are exposed to high systemic levels of adrenal androgens from week 7 of
                        gestation. Thus, they have ambiguous genitalia at birth: a large clitoris, rugated
                        and potentially fused labia majora, and a common urogenital sinus instead of
                        separate urethra and vagina. The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries are normally
                        formed, but there is no development of Wolffian ducts.</p>
                     <p>Postnatally, in untreated or inadequately treated patients, long-term exposure to
                        high sex hormones promotes rapid somatic growth and advanced bone age. Linear growth
                        is affected, even with close therapeutic monitoring. Pubic and axillary hair may
                        develop early. Clitoral growth may continue in girls. Young boys may have penile
                        growth despite having small testes. Long-term exposure to androgens may activate the

                        years varies from 21% to 28%. These so-called testicular adrenal rest tumors are
                        benign, often related to suboptimal therapy, and usually, a decrease in size after
                        optimization of glucocorticoid therapy.&#160;Testicular masses in boys with classic
                        CAH are usually bilateral and smaller than 2 cm in diameter and therefore not
                        palpable but detectable by ultrasound.</p>

                     <p>Approximately 25% of patients with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency present with
                        simple virilization without salt wasting. The simple virilizing form most commonly
                        results from point mutations that lead to amino acid substitution, causing low but
                        detectable enzyme activity resulting in adequate aldosterone secretion, but
                        decreased levels of cortisol.</p>

                        Later diagnosis is associated with greater difficulty in achieving hormonal control,

                     <p>The nonclassic or late-onset form is more common, occurring in&#160;0.1% to 0.2% in
                        the general white population and 1% to 2% among Ashkenazi Jews. Females with the
                        nonclassic form may be compound heterozygotes with a classic mutation and variant
                        allele or heterozygotes with two variant alleles, allowing 20% to 60% of normal
                        enzymatic activity.</p>
                     <p>Compound heterozygote females have a less severe phenotype, and clinical
                        presentation varies. Females may present at any age but usually not younger than 6
                        months. Heterozygote females may have mild biochemical abnormalities but no
                        clinically important endocrine disorder.</p>
                     <p>Patients with nonclassic form, have normal levels of cortisol and aldosterone at the
                        expense of mild to moderate overproduction of sex hormones precursors. Newborn
                        screening can detect nonclassic cases, but most are missed because of relatively low
                        baseline levels of 17 hydroxyprogesterone.</p>
                     <p>Hirsutism is the single most common symptom at presentation, followed by
                        oligomenorrhea and acne. Thus, nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency and polycystic
                        ovarian syndrome may present in similar ways.</p>

                        <li>Hydrocortisone is the treatment of choice because of its short half-life and

                        <li>The efficacy of treatment is best assessed by monitoring ACTH, 17-OHP, DHEA, and

                           higher than normal, helps to avoid the adverse effects of overtreatment. Children
                           also should have an annual bone age radiograph and careful monitoring of linear

                           patients require up to 0.4 mg per day) and sodium chloride (1 to 2 g, each gram
                           of sodium chloride contains 17 mEq of sodium)</li>
                        <li>The sodium content of human milk or most infant formulas are about eight mEq/L,

                           renin levels suggest the need to increase the dose, whereas hypertension,
                           tachycardia, and suppressed PRA production are clinical signs of overtreatment.
                        </li>

                        for corrective surgery. Risks and benefits of surgery should be fully discussed with
                        parents of affected females.</p>
                     <p>Significantly virilized females usually undergo surgery before 1 year of age. If
                        there is severe clitoromegaly, the clitoris is reduced, with partial excision of the
                        corporal bodies and preservation of the neurovascular bundle. Vaginoplasty and
                        correction of the urogenital sinus usually are performed at the time of clitoral
                        surgery. Revision in adolescence is often necessary.</p>

                        get enough glucocorticoids, he or she can develop&#160;adrenal insufficiency and
                        further virilization in the virilizing forms. If a patient receives excessive
                        glucocorticoids, he or she can develop growth failure, obesity, striae,

                     <p>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a relatively rare autosomal recessive disorder,
                        but the diagnosis carries significant mental and physical morbidity and mortality.
                        The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a
                        geneticist, endocrinologist, pediatrician, nurse, and a mental health
                        counselor.&#160; Prenatal diagnosis and&#160;treatment of affected females is very
                        important to minimize genital virilization. Because 21-hydroxylase deficiency is
                        often undiagnosed in affected males until they have
                        severe&#160;adrenal&#160;insufficiency, all US states and many other countries have
                        instituted newborn screening programs that measure 17-hydroxyprogesterone
                        concentration). Newborn screening&#160;can detect almost all infants with classic
                        CAH and some infants with nonclassic CAH.<a href="#ref_29956047" id="link_29956047">[15]</a></p>
