On March 18, 2019, PMC will no longer provide bulk packages of Open Access (OA) Subset text and XML at the top level directory of the FTP Service. These files were superseded in August 2016 by the Commercial Use and Non-Commercial Use bulk packages located in the oa_bulk subdirectory. One set comprises articles that may be used for commercial purposes (the Commercial Use Collection); the other contains articles that can be used only for non-commercial purposes. Anyone planning to use OA subset content for non-commercial purposes will need to download both ?non_comm_use.*.tar.gz? and ?comm_use.*.tar.gz? to access the complete collection. See the Open Access Subset page (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/ for additional details. Questions should be directed to pubmedcentral@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
